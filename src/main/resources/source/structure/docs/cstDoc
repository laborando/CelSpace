Basic:
;pre <- Sets Instruction State to pre. Should be first!
innit() <- Must be first! Innits the Structure Object
;out <- Breaks out of the Instruction State

;structure <- Sets Instruction state to Structure
0,0,0=DIRT <- Sets the Block 0,0,0 relative to the structure Center to Dirt
;out
# comment <- Comments can be made with a #
return() <- Returns the object to the inquiring function. Needs to be called last and MUST BE CALLED!

z= <- Sets the Center relative to the Center relative to where it will be centered by the code
rel=true/false <- Sets "force Y Coord Relative to the highest place there"
;out <- Breaks out of the Instruction State
